# Basic molar mass calculator
Very basic JS application.

Just write your formula and the molar mass will appear.

It recognises:
- Elements (written as their periodic table symbols).
- Numbers (up to 9).
- Frequent o-chem abbreviations such as 'Me' for methyl or 'Ph' for 'phenyl' (will probably add some more).

For the moment, it does NOT recognise:
- Parentheses (working on that).
- Numbers bigger than 9 (also working on that).
- 'Ac' for 'acetyl', as it creates a conflict with element Actinium.
- Words. Won't recognise 'tri-' or 'acetyl'.
