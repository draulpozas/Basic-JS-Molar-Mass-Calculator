# Basic molar mass calculator
Very basic JS application.

Just write your formula and the molar mass will appear.

For the moment, it does not recognise:
- Parentheses (working on that).
- Numbers bigger than 9.
- Words. Won't recognise 'hexane' or 'acetyl', although it will recognise frequent o-chem abbreviations such as 'Me' for methyl or 'Ph' for 'phenyl', and calculate accordingly.
- Despite that, it doesn't recognise 'Ac' for 'acetyl', as it creates a conflict with element Actinium.
